# uuidgen

This is a quick UUID generator for BASH and windows CMD
Created for a workshop in course, no fancy elements/functionalities here.

To make it work:
* Clone this repo
* Add the folder where this files are contained to the path (just the folder)
* Call (Type on your command line interface): **uuidgen**

You should see a UUID code printed on the console
